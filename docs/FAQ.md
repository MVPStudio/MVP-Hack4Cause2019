# MVP Studio FAQ

### What does the acronym MVP stand for?
MVP is [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and it speak to the zone where we play a part:  Getting projects from demo to that first stage where it's useful for the civic org. We are not launching fully service products.

### Who owns the products you host?
The civic org owns the product and the rights to the domain, any IP, etc. The source code is typically open-source. MVP Studio doesn't own anything attached to the products

### why do orgs need to transfer the project domain?
We manage the DNS and provide SSL certificates. So the hosting service and SSL work properly we need to host the DNS on our cloud.  There is a more technical answer and you can send us a message.

### Where are the projects hosted
All our projects are currently hosted on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)  

### What services to you provide?
We provide hosting (that includes some coaching), and a 3-month program called a sprint that can make improvements to your project.

### How much is Hosting + Coaching?
$50.00 per month paid in a single annual payment.

### How much is a Sprint?
Sprint fees vary from project to project but typically start at $10K.  We can help you form a team, provide structure, and pay the contributors for a 3-month sprint.  Team size and amount of work to do will drive the budget.

### Where does the money go?
Right now all our fees go to cover hosting and the our paid inters that participate in the DevOps internship program.
