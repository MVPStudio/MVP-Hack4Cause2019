# MVP Studio FAQ

### What does the acronym MVP stand for?
MVP is [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and it speak to the zone where we play a part:  Getting projects from demo to that first stage where it's useful for the civic org. We are not launching fully service products.

### What's a "Studio" in this context?
A "studio" is a place where you go to produce something or publish something.  Like music or film, a studio will have everything you need to make a professional project and can coach you thru the process.  MVP Studio fulfills that need for civic software projects.

### Who owns the projects you host?
The civic org owns the product and the rights to the domain, any IP, etc. The source code is typically open-source. MVP Studio doesn't own anything attached to the products

### Where are the projects hosted
All our projects are currently hosted on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)  

### why do orgs need to transfer the project domain?
We manage the DNS and provide SSL certificates. So the hosting service and SSL work properly we need to host the DNS on our cloud.  There is a more technical answer and you can send us a message.

### What services to you provide?
We provide hosting (that includes some coaching), and a 3-month program called a sprint that can make improvements to your project.

### How much is Hosting + Coaching?
$50.00 per month paid in a single annual payment.

### Where does the money go?
Right now all our fees go to cover hosting and the our paid inters that participate in the DevOps internship program.

### How much is a Sprint?
Sprint fees vary from project to project but typically start at $10K.  We can help you form a team, provide structure, and pay the contributors for a 3-month sprint.  Team size and amount of work to do will drive the budget.

### Can we run our project thru multiple sprints?
Sure.  At some point we'll chat about if your project is morphing into a product.  We don't have a product focus.

### What's the difference between a project and a product?
Projects are specificially focused on the needs of a particular civic org.  Products are something you are building with the intention to sell.
