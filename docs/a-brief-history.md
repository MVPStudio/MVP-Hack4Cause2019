# A Brief History of MVP Studio

## 2016 - 15th Night & MVP Studio as a proof-of-concept
Post Hack4Cause 2016 the 15th Night Rapid Alert Network (RAN) Project was looking to move forward from demo to something the 15Th Night partner organizations (EPD, Schools, Churches, Services) could use to help the at-risk youth.  3 Hack4Cause teams addressed the issue and all team members were gathered to form a new team around a combined solution.  OSLC was the budget holder but didn't want to manage the project or pay individual team members, so some leaders formed a one-time project called MVP Studio and ran it thru DEED as it's fiscal sponsor and payroll accounting.  Half-a-dozen intern developers, industry-pros, trainers and leaders shipped the RAN by the end of the year and it was a big success.  The 15th night project went on to be an example of partnerships between the tech community and civic orgs and a win for Hack4Cause.  It was stressful, and messy, and we all learned a great deal in the process. 

## 2017 - MVP Studio as a CodeChops internship program
A number of interns and industry pros worked on the MVPStudio.org web site as part of design and programming internships from Lane Community College.  The trifecta of internship program, civic volunteerism, continuity of service for local orgs took shape. 

## 2018 - Emerald Citizen & MVP Studio as an LLC  
During the planning season for Hack4Cause 2019 the gap between hack-demos and real software that was useful to the orgs was approached again.  MVP Studio reformed with fresh leaders and shopped around for 501c3 sponsorship with a desire to be an economic development program.  Without support from a fiscal sponsor, MVP Studio LLC was created to establish relationships with hosting providers.  Emerald Citizen because the first officially hosted project and received some awards for general awesomeness.

## 2019 - Open Leaders, SOAR, & Hack4Cause
MVP Studio leadership participated in the first Open Leaders training from January to April with the goal of launching MVP Studio at the next Hack4Cause. The SOAR program from 2018 Hack4Cause was hosted on  MVP's Google Compute Platform and maintained by University of Oregon DevOps interns and volunteer industry pros. MVP Studio is attending the 2019 Hack4Cause to help teams focus on delivering projects and leave the hosting and devops to us.
