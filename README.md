# MVP Studio at Hack4Cause 2019 in Eugene Oregon

Welcome to the MVP Studio explainer repo for [Hack4Cause 2019](https://hackforacause.org/) where you'll learn [who we are](docs/about.md) and [what Services](docs/services.md) we are providing for participants at the Hack.

## We are here to let you focus on development
By providing google cloud hosting for [qualifying](repo-criteria.md) teams during the event.  We are also providing continuous integration builds so you don't need to worry about deploying your app.  Of course there are plenty of [details](how-it-works.md) and as Tech Mentors for the event, we can walk you thru them.

## Helping civic organizations take next steps.
Post-hack, having all the credentials, API keys and configuration details with MVP Studio will help the civic orgs transition to the next step whatever that might be.

## Why do we do this?
MVP Studio is mostly comprized of volunteers who have seen civic projects fail because they don't have continuity of service.  Often a technically capable volunteer will create an app for an org and then move on.  When this happens the org suffers and it's tricky and expensive to pick up the pieces.  MVP Studio is Eugene's only DevOps internship program.  We have a constant rotation of students providing care and feeding to these civic apps while they are learning high-demand job skills.

### Thanks for stopping by and we hope to see you in person at the Hack! :tada:
